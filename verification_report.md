## Verification Report: Influence of P38 and Jnk on PKC

- **Claim 1**: P38 has no direct influence on PKC.
  - **Verification**: Evidence indicates potential interactions between P38 MAPK and PKC pathways.

      - [Protein Kinase C Promotes Apoptosis in LNCaP Prostate Cancer Cells through Activation of p38 MAPK and Inhibition of the Akt Survival Pathway](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(20)83679-5/fulltext) suggests an interaction where PKC can activate p38 MAPK.
  
- **Claim 2**: Jnk has no direct influence on PKC.
  - **Verification**: Some studies indicate that Jnk can be influenced by upstream signaling involving PKC.

      - [Requirements for PKC-augmented JNK activation by MKK4/7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1357272507003950) illustrates that PKC can enhance JNK activation, implying that while Jnk may not directly influence PKC, they are part of interconnected signaling cascades.

- **Claim 3**: P38 and Jnk are independently regulated without cross-talk affecting PKC.
  - **Verification**: There is evidence of regulatory interactions between these pathways.
    - Source:
      - [Protein Kinase C-independent Activation of Protein Kinase D Is Involved in BMP-2-induced Activation of Stress Mitogen-activated Protein Kinases JNK and p38 and Osteoblastic Cell Differentiation](http://www.jbc.org/content/279/1/259.full.pdf) suggests that both kinases can be activated in contexts involving BMP-2, indicating some level of interaction.

### Summary:
The claims that P38 and Jnk do not directly influence PKC are not entirely supported by existing literature. Both pathways have shown interconnectedness through various mechanisms, and existing studies highlight the potential for regulatory interactions that complicate the inference of independence. Further empirical evidence may clarify these relationships but current indications suggest a more integrated signaling landscape.
